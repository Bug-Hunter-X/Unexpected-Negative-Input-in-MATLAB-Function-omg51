# MATLAB Bug: Handling Unexpected Negative Input

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB: handling unexpected negative inputs. The original `myFunction` throws an error if given a negative input. The solution shows a more robust implementation that handles negative inputs gracefully.

## Bug
The `bug.m` file contains a function that throws an error when a negative input is provided.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file demonstrates an improved version of the function. It checks for negative inputs and handles them appropriately, preventing the error.
